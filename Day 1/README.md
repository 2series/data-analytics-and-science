### Exercise 1: Loan prediction problem

#### Description
Original contest can be found [here](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/)  
Python notebooks provided are heavily inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/complete-tutorial-learn-data-science-python-scratch-2/)

It is a good exercise to learn how to understand the data you are working with.
It will also provide basic Python methods for exploring and visualizing basic stats about your data.
